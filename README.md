This repository contains my practice code from the *Sigma Web Development Course* by CodeWithHarry, a comprehensive web development series available on YouTube. I've been following along to strengthen my understanding of front-end and back-end technologies, applying each concept through hands-on coding exercises. This project serves as a reflection of my learning and growth in web development. I aim to keep improving and building real-world applications as I continue my journey in tech.
